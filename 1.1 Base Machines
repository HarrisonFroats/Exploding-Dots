1. a) Verify that the code for 13 is 1101 in a 1<2 machine.

[.][.][][.]
2^3+2^2+0+1=13
Each dot in the 1<2 machine represents 2^x besides the first one, when it is added up the sum is 13. 

b) What is the code for 50?

[.][.][][][.][]
2^5+2^4+0+0+2+0=50
The code for 50 is 110010.

2. Could a number ever have 100211 as it's code in a 1<2 machine?

No this code would be impossible because if there were 2 dots in a box in a 1<2 machine they would explode and move to the left.

3. Which number has code 10101 in a 1<2 machine?

[.][][.][][.]
2^4+0+2^2+0+1=21
The code 10101 represents the number 21 in a 1<2 machine.

4. a)Show that the 1<3 code for 4 is 11.

[.][.]
3+1=4
The code for 4 is 11 in a 1<3 machine.

b)Show that the 1<3 code for 20 is 202

[:][][:]
3^2x2+0+1x2=20
When the code is 202 it represents 20.

5. What is the code for a)13? b)25?

a)[.][.][.]
3^2+3+1=13
13 in a 1<3 machine represents 111

b)[:][:][.]
3^2x2+3x2+1=25
25 in a 1<3 machine represents 221

6.Is it possible for a number to have 1<3 code 2031? Explain.

No because if there were 3 dots in one box in a 1<3 machine they would explode and move one to the left.

7.What number has 1<3 code 1022?

[.][][:][:]
3^3+0+3x2+1x2=35
The code 1022 represents the number 35.

8. a)What do you think the 1<4 rule is?

I think the rule for the 1<4 machine is when there are 4 dots in a box they will explode and move one to the left.

b)What is the 1<4 code for the number 13?

[:.][.]
4x3+1=13
The code for 13 is 31.

9. What is the 1<5 code for the number 13?

[:][:.]
5x2+1x3=13
The code for 13 is 23.

10. What is the 1<9 code for the number 13?

[.][::]
9+1x4=13
The code for the number 13 in a 1<9 machine is 14.

11. What is the 1<5 code for number 12.

[:][:]
5x2+1x2=12
The number 12 in a 1<5 machine represents the code 22.

12. What is the 1<9 code for the number 30?

[:.][:.]
9x3+1x3=30
The code for the 30 is 33.

13. What is the 1<10 code for a)13 b)37 c)273 d)5846

a) [.][:.]
10+1x3=13
The code for the number 13 is 13.

b)[:.][:::.]
10x3+1x7=37
The code for the 37 is 37.

c)[:][:::.][:.]
10^2x2+10x7+1x3=273
The code for 273 is 273.
